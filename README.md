# ⛏ fullstack-starter

Another f\*\*king boilerplate for Express and React.

**This one is full stack though?**

## Why? 😯

Because I'm tired of rewriting these things over and over again, and I'm sure some other people are too.

This is mostly an experiment so use at your own caution, I will be developing this for a bit.

* ### First:
   * *Clone this puppy!*
    * Delete the current repo: `rm -rf .git`
    * Initialize a new repo: `git init`
* ### Then:
    * Install the deps: `npm install`
    * Run the development server: `npm start`
    * Run the tests: `npm test`

## Success

Start writing some code!
