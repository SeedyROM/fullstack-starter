# ‚õè fullstack-starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeedyROM/fullstack-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SeedyROM/fullstack-starter)

Another f\*\*king boilerplate for Express and React, it also has unit testing support with Mocha, Chai and Enzyme.

**This one is full stack though?**

## Why? üòØ

Because I'm tired of rewriting these things over and over again, and I'm sure some other people are too.

This is mostly an experiment so use at your own caution, I will be developing this for a bit.

* ### First:
   * *Clone this puppy!*
    * Delete the current repo: `rm -rf .git`
    * Initialize a new repo: `git init`
* ### Then:
    * Install the deps: `npm install`
    * Run the development server: `npm start`
    * Run the tests: `npm test`

## Success

Start writing some code!
